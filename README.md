# Description
Most data scientists are familiar with Fisher's Iris Dataset. The original Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset presented here provides images for the space species of iris that were chosen by Fisher.

The project provides two files :
<ol>
  <li><strong>image_processing.py </strong> contains necessary functions to load and preprocess images <strong>load_data</strong>, <strong>show_img</strong>, <strong>data_augmenter</strong> and <strong>data_rescaling</strong></li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>The notebook</strong> Main.ipynb</li>
</ol>
